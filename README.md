This project aims to distinguish some relationships of asthma and healthcare provider visits and asthma-related emergency room visits in the US from 2017-March 2020 by using data from the NHANES. The goals of this study will be attained through the aims: 1) determine asthma prevalence for 2017-March 2020, 2) determine the rate of asthma-related emergency visits and the effects of social determinants of health, and 3) determine the relationship between healthcare provider visits and asthma-related emergency room visits, and the effects of social determinants of health.

Files included in this repository include the NHANES data set, an R markdown file of the main project report, and a html document of the main project report, as well as some exported plots and tables.
